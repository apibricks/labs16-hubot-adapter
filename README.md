[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-grpc/hubot-grpc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hubot-grpc/hubot-grpc)

```hubot-grpc``` is a plugin for the [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) chatbot which allows to generically call grpc services directly from chat applications like Slack.

It features:
  - A generic way to map grpc services into the chat format (This is part of [API bricks](https://github.com/apibricks) where also different mappings to e.g. RESTful services are available)
  - A YAML configuration format for enhancing the user experience when interacting with the service
  - Containerized execution using docker
